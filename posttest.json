      "question": "If we stretch a wire, the amount it stretches depends upon?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Diameter",
        "b": "The material it is made of",
        "c": "All the above",
        "d": "Length"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Stretch depends on diameter.",
        "b": "Material also affects stretch (via Young's modulus).",
        "c": "Correct. All these factors influence stretching.",
        "d": "Length is also a factor."

      "answers": {
        "a": "Young's Modulus",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Young's Modulus applies to longitudinal stress.",
        "b": "Incorrect.",
        "c": "Correct. Rigidity Modulus (or Shear Modulus) relates to shear.",
        "d": "Poisson's Ratio is a different elastic constant."

      "question": "What is the unit of transverse to longitudinal strain of a loaded specimen?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Nm⁻²",
        "b": "No unit",
        "c": "Pascal",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Nm⁻² is a unit of pressure.",
        "b": "Correct. Strain is a ratio, so it is dimensionless.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Pascal is for pressure.",
