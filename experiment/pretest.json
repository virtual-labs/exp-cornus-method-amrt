        "a": "Young's Modulus is an elastic constant.",
        "b": "Rigidity Modulus is an elastic constant.",
        "c": "Correct. Refractive index is related to optics, not elasticity.",

        "a": "Incorrect. Force has different units (Newtons).",
        "b": "Incorrect. Young's Modulus has a unit.",
