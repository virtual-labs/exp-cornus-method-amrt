      "question": "Which among the following is not regarded as an elastic constant of a material?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Young's Modulus",
        "b": "Rigidity Modulus",
        "c": "Refractive index",

        "a": "Young's Modulus is an elastic constant.",
        "b": "Rigidity Modulus is an elastic constant.",
        "c": "Correct. Refractive index is related to optics, not elasticity.",
        "d": "Poisson's Ratio is an elastic constant."

        "a": "Stretch depends on diameter.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Nm⁻² is a unit of pressure.",
        "b": "Correct. Strain is a ratio, so it is dimensionless.",
